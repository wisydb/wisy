In that context, the module \"admin/lang/basic\" is especially important, in that it is the languages that are used in this module that determine the languages available in  [[iloginlogout|login screen]] .\n\nThus, when you have  selected a module and the languages you want to be displayed, you can modify the module in various ways:\n\n- '''edit entries:''' Just click on the entry you want to modify in the overview, change the strings and confirm the change with \"OK\".\n\n- '''new entry:''' Click on \"new entry\" in the overview, enter the ID of the new entry, with a comment if appropriate. A new entry will always be created in ''all'' the  module languages at the same time. Usually, new entries will only be created by the system provider. \n\n- '''delete entry:''' Go into mask \"edit entry\" (see above) and click on \"delete entry\". When you have confirmed the command, the entry will be deleted in ''all'' languages. Usually, entries will only be deleted by the system provider.\n\n- '''new language:''' Click on \"new language\" in the overview and enter the ID of the new language - \"de\", \"en\", \"fr\", \"es\" etc. If you click on \"OK\", the language will be applied to ''all'' the entries defined in the module. When the new language has been created, these entries will  either be shown as empty or can then be initialised with the entries in an existing language.   \n\n- '''delete language:''' Go into mask \"edit entry\" (see above) and click on \"delete language\". When you confirm the command, the language you have selected will be deleted, together with ''all'' entries.\n\nSometimes you  may be informed that entries and/or languages cannot be modified. If that happens, you will have to alter or grant the '''access rights''' for the relevant files so that they can be written by PHP.");

Authorisation can be provided by the [[isupervisor|supervisor]].\n\nIn order to administer users, click on table \"user\" in the [[imainmenu|main menu / etc]].\n\nThis table contains a list of all users with access to the system. By clicking on a user you can modify his/her access rights in relation to every table and other areas of the system:\n\n- For '''rights on record level''', all users are organised first of all into '''Groups''', i.e. users belong to one or more groups (members of a group usually grant each other extensive rights to their records; the groups themselves are administered from another table, for which click on \"groups\" at the top left-hand side; the owner/originator can then determine to which group s/he wants to belong in relation to each of his/her records, and which rights s/he wants to retain or to give to other group members or users, see  [[ieditrecords|edit records]] under \"rights\").\n\n- The Supervisor issues '''rights on table level and/or field level''' (field \"rights\") independently of the groups. To do that, the table(s) and/or the field(s) for which a rule is required are selected by clicking on '''new grant...'''. For example, a click on \n\n-- '''my_table.*''' selects all fields in the table \"my_table\",\n\n-- '''*.my_field''' selects all fields \"my_fieldquot; in all tables containing it,\n\n-- '''*.*''' selects all fields and all tables including specials such as \"SUPERVISOR\" or \"LOCALIZE\".<br /><br />Rules can thus be constructed in relation to the rights '''new''', '''read''', '''edit''' and '''delete'''. The \"nearest\" rule will apply, i.e.:\"<br /><br />\n\n-- '''my_table.my_field''' supercedes \"my_table.*\", \"*.my_field\" and even \"*.*\"\n-- '''my_table.*''' supercedes the rule \"*.*\"in this table.\n-- '''*.my_field''' supercedes the rule \"*.*\" in this field.\n-- There is one exception to this principle: if, for example, there is a rule for '''*.my_field''' and '''my_table.*''', but not for '''my_table.my_field''', logic will prevail and the rights will be linked by AND.\n\n- A user with rights to write in the User table can '''create new users'''; however, s/he can only allocate groups and rights that s/he has him/herself, i.e. no user can create a user with more rights than s/he has him/herself.\n\n- A user who can modify '''SUPERVISOR.my_group''' is the supervisor for this group, which means that s/he can modify all records relating to this group, irrespective of whether this is allowed by the owner. However, ''which'' table or fields s/he can modify depends on the rights issued to him/her.\n\n- A user with rights to write in the Groups table can '''create new groups'''.\n\nYou can also set the name, the log-in name and the password for all users. However, the password may be altered independently by the user, see [[ipassword|change password]].\n\nUnder \"settings\" you will find the personlised [[isettings|settings]] applied by each user. If you add \n\"settings.editable=0\" to it, the user will be unable to alter the settings.  This can be useful for Guest Accounts or Multi-User Accounts.\n\nAt the bottom of the page, you will also find the time of the last successful log-in and the last failed log-in. After a number of failed log-ins, access by that user will be blocked for security reasons. This account can be released if you set \"number of login errors\" manually to zero. \n\n==Status code overview==\n\n| 0  | User has not logged in\n| 1  | User has logged in\n| >1 | Failed attempt to log in, user logged in successfully after an unspecified number of attempts, after a specified number of attempts user failed to log in.\n| >=1000 | Account blocked anyway.
